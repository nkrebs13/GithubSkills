## Detailed Rubrics

### 1. Brand Alignment (25%)

Measures how effectively the asset communicates the app's purpose, values, and target audience.

| Score | Level | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| 10 | Exceptional | Perfect embodiment of brand essence. Instantly communicates app purpose. Color, style, and imagery are cohesive with overall brand system. Would be recognized as "on-brand" by any stakeholder. |
| 9 | Excellent | Strong brand representation with minor room for tighter alignment. Core message clear, supporting elements highly appropriate. |
| 8 | Very Good | Clearly communicates brand intent. Colors and imagery appropriate. May have one element that could be more tightly integrated. |
| 7 | Good | Solid brand connection evident. Appropriate category signals. Some elements feel slightly generic or could better express brand personality. |
| 6 | Adequate | Recognizable as belonging to the correct app category. Brand expression is present but not distinctive. Safe and acceptable. |
| 5 | Mixed | Partially aligned. Some elements work, others feel disconnected from brand intent. Mixed signals about app purpose. |
| 4 | Weak | Limited brand connection. Could belong to many different apps. Category recognition requires explanation. |
| 3 | Poor | Minimal brand alignment. Visual style conflicts with app purpose or target audience expectations. |
| 2 | Very Poor | Contradicts brand intent. Would confuse users about app purpose. Inappropriate for target market. |
| 1 | Unacceptable | No discernible brand connection. Random or actively harmful to brand perception. |

**Evaluation Questions:**
- Does this immediately suggest what the app does?
- Would the target audience find this appealing?
- Does it fit with the app's tone (serious/playful/professional/casual)?
- Are colors consistent with brand guidelines (if established)?

```

### Example Calculation

| Criterion | Score | Weight | Weighted |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|
| Brand Alignment | 8 | 0.25 | 2.00 |
| Clarity | 9 | 0.25 | 2.25 |
| Professionalism | 7 | 0.20 | 1.40 |
| Uniqueness | 6 | 0.15 | 0.90 |
| Technical Quality | 8 | 0.15 | 1.20 |
| **Composite** | | | **7.75** |

## Comparative Evaluation

When evaluating multiple options:

### Ranking Protocol

1. Score each option independently
2. Calculate composite scores
3. Rank by composite score
4. Break ties using:
   - Highest Brand Alignment wins
   - If tied, highest Clarity wins
   - If still tied, user preference decides

### Side-by-Side Analysis

For final selection between close options:

```
Option A (7.8) vs Option B (7.6)

| Criterion       | A    | B    | Winner |
|----------------|------|------|--------|
| Brand          | 8    | 7    | A      |
| Clarity        | 7    | 9    | B      |
| Professionalism| 8    | 7    | A      |
| Uniqueness     | 7    | 7    | Tie    |
| Technical      | 9    | 8    | A      |

Recommendation: Option A (stronger overall, particularly in brand and professionalism)
Consideration: If clarity is paramount for this use case, Option B may be preferred despite lower composite.
